🎭 FACIAL-EMOTION-RECOGNITION-YKG
🚀 AI-Powered Facial Emotion Recognition System
An advanced Deep Learning model for real-time facial emotion detection, built using CNN & TensorFlow with a user-friendly GUI interface for seamless interaction.

📌 This project was developed as part of my AI/ML Internship at ShadowFox Company, a multinational firm based in Bengaluru & Sydney.

📌 About the Project
This AI-powered Facial Emotion Recognition System is designed to accurately classify human emotions using deep learning techniques. The model leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained on the FER 2013 dataset to detect facial expressions in images or video streams.

🔹 Unique Feature: The model can self-learn over time by integrating new training data for continual learning!
🔹 Graphical User Interface (GUI): A well-structured and interactive Tkinter-based GUI for ease of use.

🎯 Potential Use Cases
✅ Real-time emotion analysis in AI-driven applications
✅ Enhancing human-computer interaction (e.g., AI assistants, chatbots)
✅ Mental health monitoring through emotion recognition
✅ Customer sentiment analysis for business insights
✅ Interactive gaming & VR experiences based on facial expressions

🌟 Unique Features & Special Capabilities
✔ AI-Driven Emotion Classification: Uses CNN for precise emotion detection
✔ Self-Learning Ability: Can continuously improve with new data integration
✔ Real-Time Analysis Potential: Optimized for real-time applications
✔ Automated Data Preprocessing: Uses advanced data augmentation techniques
✔ High Accuracy & Performance: Dropout layers help minimize overfitting
✔ Optimized Model Training: Implements Early Stopping & ModelCheckpoint
✔ Scalable & Efficient: Can be easily expanded with more emotion classes
✔ Interactive GUI: Built using Tkinter for easy navigation & testing

🔬 How the Model Works?
1️⃣ Image Preprocessing
Automated augmentation (rotation, flipping, zooming, brightness adjustments)
Rescaling images to improve model generalization
Grayscale conversion for optimal feature extraction
2️⃣ Model Training
A deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) extracts facial features
Dropout layers prevent overfitting
Uses Adam optimizer and Categorical Crossentropy loss function
3️⃣ Emotion Classification
The trained model classifies input images into emotions like:
😃 Happy, 😢 Sad, 😠 Angry, 😐 Neutral, 😲 Surprise, 🤢 Disgust, 😨 Fear
4️⃣ Continuous Learning
The system can be fine-tuned with new datasets
Incremental training allows real-world adaptability
